#Product Recommendation After Purchase -- Does Apriori Make a Better Recommendation?

---

<br/>

### Introduction

**Durning last internship, I used apriori to improve the recommendation system of my company, KKday. <a href = "https://www.kkday.com">KKday</a> is a leading e-commerce travel platform in South East Asia. In this article, I am going to use the sales data from KKday to illustrate the performance and difference of apriori and distance-based recommendation system.**

### Data Preprocessing

```{r echo=FALSE}
###Import order dataset
data = read.csv("~/Google Drive/kkday/ Data Team Project/order_uesr.csv",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r }
require(dplyr)
require('DT')
```

<h4> The Original Data</h4>
```{r}
head(data,10)
```
The data contains products in past 14 days which have been ordered by users. 'product_oid' is the code of each product, while user_id is an user who bought the product. For example, we can say user '132591' has bought the product '8332' and '3598' together.

<h4>Combine Orders by Same User</h4>

```{r}
df <- data %>%
  group_by(user_id) %>%
  summarise(prod_oid_paste = paste(prod_oid, collapse=" "),
            n = n()) %>% filter(n >1) #remove order that only contain one product
head(df)

retail.list <-  df
#Seperate by ""
retail.list <- sapply(retail.list$prod_oid_paste,strsplit, " ")
head(retail.list)
```

The data has to be transformed into 'transaction' type in order to fit in the packages, arules, which we will explore later.

Therefore, we have to group data by user_id and paste the orders together. Now, the original dataframe has been transformed into a list, and each row means a market basket ordered by a certain customer.

<h4>Transfrom Order Data into Transaction Data</h4>
```{r}
require(arules)
```

```{r}
retail.trans <- as(retail.list, "transactions")
summary(retail.trans)
```

By transforming into transactions data and using the summary function, we can see product '2674' is the most frequent product which appeared in 12115 customers' orders. And the median product in customers' orders is 2 -> at least 50 % of people have only two product in each order.

### Implementing Association Rules
Depends on researcher's experience and the purpose, we have to set three parameters in arules: confidence, support, and lift, to extract meaningful patterns.

Here we are going to set support, confidence as thresholds, which is common in most research. 

<h4>Setting Parameters to extract frequent patterns</h4>
```{r}
sup = 0.0001
conf = 0.1
retail.rules <- apriori(retail.trans, parameter=list(supp=sup, conf=conf))
```

Knowing that there are thousands of products on KKday, we set a conservative threshould to secure that we could have enough patterns to make recommendation. We get 4400 association rules eventually.



<h4>Visualize the support/confidence distribution with arulesViz</h4>
```{r message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# install.packages("arulesViz")
library(arulesViz)
arulesViz::plotly_arules(retail.rules)
```
This interactive visualization tools can help us determine the parameters. By observing the distribution and the number of rules, we can see whether to increase the threshold or not.

<h4>Which products are most frequently bought together</h4>
```{r}
retail.conf <- head(sort(retail.rules, by="confidence"), 20)
inspect(retail.conf)
```
By sorting the rules from highest confidence, we can see that the product '12225' has 100% chance being bought together with 11359, yet this combination only has been bought for 28 times, which only count for 0.01% of total orders. On the other hand, Product '5260' has 81% chance being bought together with '5925', and '1559' people have bought the same bundle. This means that we could to recommend '1559' to any those customer who has bought '5925'. 

<h4>What are the patterns that contain most products</h4>
```{r}
rules_length <- lapply(LIST(retail.rules@lhs), function(x) unlist(strsplit(x, " ")))
retail_long <- head(retail.rules[order(lengths(rules_length),retail.rules@quality$confidence,decreasing = TRUE)],20)
inspect(retail_long)
```

We can see that the first 4 patterns of rhs are product '2914', meaning that these products are often being bought together.

<h4> Network Graph</h4>
```{r message = FALSE}
plot(retail.rules, method="graph", control=list(type="items"))
```

The network graph shows associations between selected products. Larger circles imply higher support, while red circles imply higher lift.

- The most popular order was of '2674' and '2685', another popular orders were '2689' and '2685'

- If someone buys '17899', he is likely to have bought 4051 as well
- Relatively many people buy '5260' along with 'sliced cheese'5925' (1559 times)

### Try Pratical Work with Recommendation
<h4> Form the Recommendation Function</h4>

```{r}
next_buy = function(new_basket){
  it_new_basket = as(list(new_basket), "itemMatrix")
# find all rules, where the lhs is a subset of the current new_basket
  rulesMatchLHS <- is.subset(retail.rules@lhs,it_new_basket)
# and the rhs is NOT a subset of the current new_basket (so that some items are left as potential recommendation)
  suitableRules <-  rulesMatchLHS & !(is.subset(retail.rules@rhs,it_new_basket))
  possible_recomed = retail.rules[as.logical(suitableRules)]
  if(length(possible_recomed)==0){
    print('No association rules pass the threshold, consider other possible combination ')
  } # Report no applicable association rules for the threshold
  else{
    lst1 <- lapply(LIST(possible_recomed@lhs), function(x) unlist(strsplit(x, " ")))
    recommendations <- strsplit(LIST(possible_recomed@rhs)[[order(possible_recomed@quality$confidence, decreasing = TRUE)[1]]],split=" ")# Report the possible recommendation by the order of confidence
    print("Potential recommendations are...")
    inspect(possible_recomed[order(possible_recomed@quality$confidence, decreasing = TRUE),])
     recommendations <- lapply(recommendations,function(x){paste(x,collapse=" ")})
    recommendations <- as.character(recommendations)
    print(paste("Best recommendation would be ",recommendations))
    return(as.character(recommendations))
  }
}
```

<h4> Enter any ProductID you are interested in</h4>
```{r}
#Test any basket you like
new_basket = c('19252')
next_buy(new_basket)
```

We can see the best recommendation after buying product 19252 is 10759


<h4> Reverse Recommendation: What Products Induce the purchasement of the Objective??</h4>

```{r}
target_one = 11731
rules<-apriori(data=retail.trans, parameter=list(supp=sup,conf = conf,minlen=2), 
               appearance = list(default="lhs",rhs=target_one),
               control = list(verbose=F))
rules<-head(sort(rules, decreasing=TRUE,by="confidence"),20)
inspect(rules)

```

### Model Comparisons: Cosine Distance vs. Apriori


<h4> Import Cosine Distance Recommendation unction</h4>

```{r echo =FALSE}
DT_filter =  data
product_list <- unique(DT_filter$prod_oid)
user_list <- unique(DT_filter$user_id)
product_list_len <- length(product_list)
user_list_len <- length(user_list)
prod_len <- c(1:product_list_len)

prod_user_temp <- Matrix(rep(0,user_list_len), nrow = 1)
prod_user <- Matrix(rep(0,user_list_len), nrow = 1)
prod_user <- Matrix(0, nrow =product_list_len ,ncol = user_list_len)

# for(i in 2 : product_list_len){
#   prod_user <<- rbind(prod_user, prod_user_temp)
# }
colnames(prod_user) <- user_list

temp <- sapply(prod_len, function(x){
  DT_filter_i_user <- DT_filter %>%
    filter(prod_oid == product_list[x]) %>%
    select(user_id)
  DT_filter_i_user_v <- as.vector(t(DT_filter_i_user))
  prod_user[x,DT_filter_i_user_v] <<- 1
  rm(DT_filter_i_user, DT_filter_i_user_v)
  if(x %% 500 == 0){
    print(paste0(x,'/',product_list_len))
  }
})

print("prod_user matrix finish")
rm(DT_filter,temp)
DT_filter_matrix <- prod_user
row.names(DT_filter_matrix) <- product_list
rm(prod_user)



DT_rowSums <- rowSums(DT_filter_matrix)
DT_rowSums_under_5 <- names(DT_rowSums)[DT_rowSums<=5]
rm(DT_rowSums)

print("start calculating cosine_score_matrix")

xxt <- DT_filter_matrix %*% t(DT_filter_matrix)
diag_xxt <- sqrt(diag(1/diag(xxt)))
score_matrix <- diag_xxt %*% xxt %*% diag_xxt
rownames(score_matrix) <- rownames(DT_filter_matrix)
colnames(score_matrix) <- rownames(DT_filter_matrix)
rm(xxt,diag_xxt)
score_matrix <- as.matrix(score_matrix)

DT_similar_prod <- data.frame(similar_prod_oid = rep(NA_real_,product_list_len*20),
                              score =  rep(NA_real_,product_list_len*20),
                              prod_oid = rep(NA_real_,product_list_len*20))

t1 <- Sys.time()
temp <- sapply(prod_len, function(x){
  DT_similar_prod[(20*x-19):(20*x),] <<-
    data.frame(score = score_matrix[x,],
               similar_prod_oid = product_list)[-x,] %>%
    arrange(desc(score)) %>%
    mutate(score_order = c(1:(product_list_len-1))) %>%
    filter(score_order <=20) %>%
    select(similar_prod_oid, score) %>%
    mutate(prod_oid = product_list[x])
  if(x %% 500 == 0){
    print(paste0(x,'/',product_list_len))
  }
} )
rm(temp)

gc()
print("End of calculation cosine_score_matrix")

```


<h4> Experiments on Different Combination</h4>

```{r}
#Apriori result
#Recommendation after buying

target_one = c(1446)
next_buy(target_one)

#Cosine Result
head(DT_similar_prod[DT_similar_prod$prod_oid==target_one,],10)
```

We can see for product 1446, both models recommends the customer to buy 2914 first.In the top 4 product for each recommendation, only one product is different. Looks like apriori doesn't give a surprise?

<h4> Experiments on Different Combination</h4>

```{r}
#Apriori result
#Recommendation after buying

target_one = c(1446,2914)
head(next_buy(target_one),10)

#Cosine Result
head(DT_similar_prod[DT_similar_prod$prod_oid==target_one,],10)
```

Apriori is particularly powerful when recommending complements. When there is 1 item in basket, we could hardly find difference of it and other. But when we have two products in our baskets, such as 2914 and 1446, then it can recommend new product 7423 base on this set.
